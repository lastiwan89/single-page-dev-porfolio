## My process

- I like to use react because of reusable components
- Typescript for indexing content for more simple code
- Tailwindcss make me relax to code and make me more fun when coding, because of taiwlind have so many feature that help me a lot.
- I love the way layer utilities in main css do more thing like configuring for more simple syntax at the tsx file
- i am also use prettier plugin tailwindcss for better sorting class
- next time i want to use husky to be better code committing.
- i am sorry if you find some semantic elements like `<br/>` in my components. i just cheat to be more flexible when displaying the text.
- i do a lot of displaying background image things. i am sorry, i just can't figure it out how to do properly to achieve the original from figma file.
- i do a lot of cheat like props too.
